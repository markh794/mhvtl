.SH NAME
vtllibrary \- user space daemon to handle SCSI SMC commands for Virtual Tape Library.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B vtllibrary
[\fI-v|-d|-f fifo\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" Add any additional description here
.PP
The vtllibrary daemon should (needs) to be started AFTER
.BR vtltape(1)
daemons. The vtllibrary registers each
.BR vtltape(1)
via message queue. The vtllibrary reads /opt/mhvtl/library.contents
and dynamically buils an internal structure of Storage slots and Media Access slots.
All media movement is performed on internal structures only. The configuration file
is never changed. i.e. A re-start of the daemon will result in the loss of any
previous media movements.
When media is moved to/from a "Data transfer element" (tape drive), a (un)load message is sent
via the drive 'slot number' message Q number to load/unload the barcode.
