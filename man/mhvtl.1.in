mhvtl \- Virtual Tape Library

.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" Add any additional description here
.PP
Virtual Tape Library consists of several components.
.PP
A LLD kernel driver -
.BR mhvtl
.PP
Target devices - Daemons
.BR vtltape(1)
 and
.BR vtllibrary(1)
which implement SCSI target device(s) in user-space.
.PP
Utility commands
.BR mktape(1),
.BR vtlcmd(1)
.PP
And startup scripts /etc/init.d/mhvtl,
.BR build_library_config(1),
.BR make_vtl_media(1)
.PP
The LLD kernel module is based on the scsi_debug kernel module
.BR (http://www.torque.net/sg/sdebug26.html).
mhvtl is a pseudo HBA (LLD)
.PP
A char device back-end has been added to the mhvtl LLD driver.
This allows data and SCSI commands to be passed from the LLD driver to
user-mode daemons (SCSI targets) via the /dev/mhvtl?? device nodes.
The target drivers
constently poll the driver and process any SCSI commands/data passed to them.
.PP
.BR vtltape(1)
write/read data to data files in the /opt/vtl directory
 (if a virtual tape has been loaded). The virtual tape files include a
Medium Auxiliary Memory (MAM) data structure to store persistent data (number
of tape loads, total data written/read, media type etc).
.PP
.BR vtllibrary(1)
reads its configuration file /etc/mhvtl/library_contents at startup.
The number of storage slots are built dynamically when the daemon starts.
Hence changing the number of storage slots and media access slots are a matter
of modifing the file contents and restarting the
.BR vtllibrary(1)
daemon.
All
\'library\' commands are performed on data structures in memory ONLY.
.PP
A message queue (key 0x4d61726b) is used to pass messages between
.BR vtltape(1),
.BR vtllibrary(1)
and
.BR vtlcmd(1)
.PP
When a SCSI move medium from a storage slot to a tape drive is requested, the
media location is updated in
.BR vtllibrary(1)
data structures, and the barcode of the media id is passed via the message
queue to the
.BR vtltape(1)
daemon in question. A file open of the barcode is attempted in the
/opt/vtl directory and if successful, the
.BR vtltape(1)
daemon will now return a ASC/ASCQ 0x0/0x0 to any Test Unit Ready requests.
An unload SCSI command to the tape drive will close the data file.
.PP
Media can be moved out of the VTL via the Media Access Port. Once media is
logically moved into the MAP slots, the MAP entries can be cleared using the
.BR "vtlcmd library empty map".

.SH BUGS
.SH TODO
Does not implement the complete SCSI command set.
.PP
Kernel module only written for Linux 2.6.x kernel series.
.PP
Data is copied from kernel buffers to/from user-space buffers. Should
use pointers to buffers, not copy each block.
